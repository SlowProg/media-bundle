ThraceMediaBundle
=================

The `ThraceMediaBundle` handles file, video, audio and image upload plus some image manipulations like 
cropping, rotating, resetting ... etc. in your Symfony 2 application. It is 100% integrated with Doctrine ORM.
It is based on [Plupload](http://www.plupload.com/) library!
Also it has hard dependency of [https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle] - used for filesystem abstraction/
and [LiipImagineBundle](https://github.com/liip/LiipImagineBundle) for image manipulation with [Imagine](https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine) library.
